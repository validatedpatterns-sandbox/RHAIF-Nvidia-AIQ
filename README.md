## Overview

The NVIDIA AI-Q Blueprint is a deployable research backend built on the [NVIDIA NeMo Agent Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/agent-toolkit/latest/) and [LangChain Deep Agents](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/deepagents/overview). Teams can self-host the application boundary and connect deployment-owned models, data sources, authentication, policy controls, storage, and observability. It provides both **quick, cited answers** and **in-depth, report-style research**, plus benchmarks and evaluation harnesses for measuring quality. AI-Q is focused on governed research workflows; it is not a general-purpose coding-agent harness.

**Key features:**

- **Orchestration node** — One node classifies intent (meta vs. research), produces meta responses (for example, greetings, capabilities), and sets research depth (shallow vs. deep).
- **Shallow research** — Bounded, faster researcher with tool-calling and source citation.
- **Structured deep research** — Advisory source routing, structured planning, concurrent researcher workers, bounded source-tool batching, and a dedicated writer produce citation-backed reports and other requested output shapes.
- **Report follow-up** — Ask questions about a completed report, create a child-job cosmetic rewrite, or run delta research with the parent report as context.
- **Workflow configuration** — YAML configs define agents, tools, LLMs, and routing behavior so you can tune workflows without code changes.
- **Modular workflows** — All agents (orchestration node, shallow researcher, deep researcher, clarifier) are composable; each can run standalone or as part of the full pipeline.
- **Skills, sandbox execution, and durable outputs** — Built-in research/synthesis skills are exposed as host-side, read-only definitions. Skills that invoke code use a provider-neutral sandbox contract; Modal and OpenShell create one physical sandbox per deep-research job. Opt-in rich-file capture checkpoints manifest-declared files after successful sandbox commands, finalizes on success/failure, stores bytes in SQL or S3-compatible storage, and delivers metadata to the Files tab live and on replay.
- **Portable Agent Skills** — `aiq-deploy` selects, starts, and validates an AI-Q deployment; `aiq-research` calls routed chat and async research from compatible coding harnesses.
- **Data source registry** — UI toggles and request payloads can select web, paper, enterprise, collaboration, and knowledge-layer sources per message.
- **Expanded sources** — Paper search supports Serper, SerpAPI, and SearchAPI; You.com adds web, contents, general-research, and finance-research tools; Nimble adds configurable web search; focused profiles demonstrate DuckDuckGo news, Polymarket, OpenSearch, and Azure AI Search knowledge retrieval.
- **Production API and auth** — REST endpoints, async job ownership, per-user OAuth-protected MCP sources, token validator entry points, and provider lifecycle hooks support authenticated deployments; a separate public MCP server exposes stateless research tools for trusted networks.
- **Opt-in policy controls** — NeMo Guardrails middleware covers selected workflow and agent boundaries, and narrow application-level encryption can protect final async output plus selected artifact-event content.
- **Observability, profiling, and cost analysis** — NeMo Relay preserves task, named-agent, LLM, and tool hierarchy across interactive turns and async researchers. ATOF feeds local debugging and tokenomics reports; OTEL exports traces to external observability backends.
- **Evaluation harnesses** — Built-in benchmarks (for example, FreshQA, DeepResearch) and evaluation scripts to measure quality and iterate on prompts and agent architecture.
- **Frontend options** — Run through CLI, web UI, or async jobs. Refer to [Deploying the demo](#deploying-the-demo) for OpenShift and [Ways to Run the Agents](#ways-to-run-the-agents) for local modes.
- **Deployment options** — Primary path: [Validated Patterns](https://validatedpatterns.io/) GitOps on OpenShift (this repository). Also: [Docker Compose](deploy/compose/) and [Helm](deploy/helm/deployment-k8s/) for direct installs; the source chart honors the Helm release namespace for every namespaced resource.

### OpenShift deployment (Validated Patterns)

This repository deploys AI-Q on [Red Hat OpenShift](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift) through the [Validated Patterns](https://validatedpatterns.io/) GitOps framework. `./pattern.sh make install` installs the Validated Patterns Operator and OpenShift GitOps, then Argo CD syncs the AI-Q Helm chart into the `aiq` namespace.

The path is **single-cluster only**: no ACM hub/spoke and no HashiCorp Vault / External Secrets Operator. Secrets use the Validated Patterns `none` backend, which writes Kubernetes Secret `aiq-credentials` from a local file. The default overlay targets an OpenAI-compatible [OpenShift AI Model as a Service (MaaS)](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_ai_self-managed/) Granite endpoint; no cluster GPU nodes are required for that profile.

## What's New

Recent changes include:

- **Structured, concurrent deep research** — Advisory source routing, structured planning,
  concurrent researcher workers, bounded source-tool batching, and a dedicated writer replace
  the earlier three-role flow and move plan ownership out of the clarifier.
- **Work that continues from a completed report** — Users can ask questions against an existing
  report, create child-job rewrites, or run delta research with the parent report as context.
- **Portable skills, sandboxes, and durable files** — Provider-neutral sandbox execution,
  the new `aiq-deploy` skill, expanded `aiq-research` workflows, opt-in artifact capture, SQL or
  S3-compatible storage, and live or replayed Files-tab access turn generated files into durable
  outputs.
- **Sources, integrations, and policy controls** — OpenSearch and Azure AI Search join the knowledge backends;
  You.com adds four search and research tools, Nimble adds configurable web search, and the standalone public MCP server exposes submit/poll/report operations; per-user MCP
  OAuth, opt-in NeMo Guardrails middleware, and narrowly scoped async-content encryption add
  deployment controls without making them universal defaults.
- **Operations and user experience** — Async traces preserve the agent hierarchy, the source Helm
  chart honors the selected release namespace, and the UI improves concurrent-research activity,
  session recovery, and WebSocket reliability.

AI-Q v2.2.0 is published on NVIDIA NGC as the
[`aiq-agent` backend container](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/blueprint/containers/aiq-agent/2.2.0),
[`aiq-frontend` web container](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/blueprint/containers/aiq-frontend/2.2.0),
and [`aiq2-web` Helm chart](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/blueprint/helm-charts/aiq2-web/2.2.0).
Each artifact uses version `2.2.0`.

See the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for detailed release history; the linked feature docs describe
configuration and current limitations.

## Software Components

The checked-in default CLI and web profiles use these core components:

- [NVIDIA NeMo Agent Toolkit 1.8.0](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/agent-toolkit/latest/)
- [LangChain Deep Agents](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/deepagents/overview) 0.6.5 or newer
- NVIDIA Nemotron 3.5 Lightning for intent classification and shallow research in the default profiles
- [NVIDIA Nemotron 3 Ultra](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/nemotron-3-ultra-550b-a55b) for clarification and every deep-research role
- [Google Gemma 4 31B IT](https://build.nvidia.com/google/gemma-4-31b-it) (document summary, if used)
- [NVIDIA Nemotron 3 Embed 1B](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/nemotron-3-embed-1b) (embedding model for the knowledge layer, if used)
- [NVIDIA Nemotron 3 Nano Omni 30B A3B Reasoning](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/nemotron-3-nano-omni-30b-a3b-reasoning) (vision-language model for the LlamaIndex knowledge layer, if used)
- [Tavily Search API](https://tavily.com/) for web search
- Serper, SerpAPI, or SearchAPI for Google Scholar paper search

> **Known hosted-serving limitation:** Nemotron 3.5 Lightning can intermittently produce citation-incomplete or
> malformed shallow drafts when served through NVIDIA API Catalog. AI-Q fails closed instead of publishing those
> drafts. The Brev getting-started launchable uses Nemotron Ultra for shallow research; the general-purpose shipped
> profiles retain Lightning. See [Troubleshooting](docs/source/resources/troubleshooting.md#nemotron-35-lightning-on-nvidia-api-catalog)
> for details and the self-hosted Lightning option.

The shipped frontier profile, `configs/config_frontier_models.yml`, uses GPT-5.6 Luna for intent classification,
shallow research, source routing, and deep-research execution, with GPT-5.6 Sol for clarification, orchestration,
planning, and writing. Treat any bring-your-own model or modified profile as an experimental customization until the
complete workflow is evaluated with that exact model, prompt, hyperparameter, tool-calling, and structured-output
configuration. Refer to
[Configuration Files](#configuration-files); there is no single all-features profile.

## Target Audience

This project is for:

- **AI researchers and developers**: People building or extending agentic research workflows
- **Enterprise teams**: Organizations needing tool-augmented research with citation-backed research
- **NeMo Agent Toolkit users**: Developers looking to understand advanced multi-agent patterns

## Prerequisites

### OpenShift (Validated Pattern)

- [Podman](https://podman.io/) (the `./pattern.sh` wrapper runs make targets in the Validated Patterns utility container)
- An OpenShift cluster and `oc` logged in with enough privilege to install operators
- Git, and a remote Argo CD can clone (this repository or your fork) with the branch pushed
- A reachable OpenAI-compatible LLM endpoint (`AIQ_INFERENCE_BASE_URL`) and model name (`MAAS_MODEL_NAME`) in `~/values-secret-aiq.yaml`
- Optional: `TAVILY_API_KEY` for web research in the cluster overlay

Default destination namespace is `aiq`. The VP install path does not require local Python or Node.js.

### Local development

- Python 3.11–3.13
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager
- NVIDIA API key from [NVIDIA AI](https://build.nvidia.com) (for NIM models)
- Node.js 22+ and npm (optional, for web UI mode)

**Optional requirements:**

- A web-search API key for the configured provider: Tavily, Exa, Nimble, or You.com
- A paper search API key for one of the supported providers: Serper (`SERPER_API_KEY`), SerpAPI (`SERPAPI_API_KEY`), or SearchAPI (`SEARCHAPI_API_KEY`)

> **Note:** Configure at least one data source (web search, paper search, or knowledge layer) to enable research functionality.

If these optional API keys are not provided, the agent continues to operate without the corresponding search capabilities. Refer to [Obtain API Keys](#obtain-api-keys) for details.

## Hardware Requirements

When using [NVIDIA API Catalog](https://build.nvidia.com/) (the default), inference runs on NVIDIA-hosted infrastructure and there are no local GPU requirements. The hardware references below apply only when self-hosting models via [NVIDIA NIM](https://docs.nvidia.com/nim/).

The default Validated Pattern overlay uses an external MaaS Granite endpoint (`AIQ_INFERENCE_BASE_URL`); **no GPU nodes are required** on the OpenShift cluster for that profile.

| Component | Default Model | Self-Hosted Hardware Reference |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------------------|
| LLM (intent classifier, shallow researcher) | `nvidia/nemotron-3.5-lightning-30b-a3b` | [Nemotron 3.5 Lightning](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/nemotron-3.5-lightning-30b-a3b/modelcard) |
| LLM (clarifier and all deep-research roles) | `nvidia/nemotron-3-ultra-550b-a55b` | [Nemotron 3 Ultra](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/nemotron-3-ultra-550b-a55b) |
| Document summary (optional) | `google/gemma-4-31b-it` | [Gemma 4 31B IT](https://build.nvidia.com/google/gemma-4-31b-it) |
| Text embedding | `nvidia/nemotron-3-embed-1b` | [NeMo Retriever embedding support matrix](https://docs.nvidia.com/nim/nemo-retriever/text-embedding/latest/support-matrix.html) |
| VLM (image/chart extraction, optional) | `nvidia/nemotron-3-nano-omni-30b-a3b-reasoning` | [Nemotron 3 Nano Omni](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/nemotron-3-nano-omni-30b-a3b-reasoning) |
| Knowledge layer (Foundational RAG, optional) | -- | [RAG Blueprint support matrix](https://docs.nvidia.com/rag/latest/support-matrix.html) |

For detailed installation instructions, refer to [Installation -- Hardware Requirements](docs/source/get-started/installation.md#hardware-requirements).

## Architecture

AI-Q uses a [LangGraph](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph)-based state machine with the following key components:

- **Orchestration node**: Classifies intent (meta vs. research), produces meta responses when needed, and sets depth (shallow vs. deep) in one step
- **Shallow research agent**: Bounded tool-augmented research optimized for speed
- **Deep research agent**: Multi-phase research with planning, iteration, and citation management

Each agent can be run individually or as part of the orchestrated workflow. For detailed architecture documentation, refer to [Architecture](docs/source/architecture/overview.md).

_Figure 1. NVIDIA AI-Q research-agent architecture._

On OpenShift, Argo CD applies the unchanged application chart at `deploy/helm/deployment-k8s` plus
`overrides/values-aiq-openshift.yaml` (MaaS Granite config mount, Postgres PVC on the cluster default
StorageClass, nginx Ingress disabled, OpenShift Route enabled for the frontend). See
[OpenShift (Validated Patterns)](docs/source/deployment/validated-patterns.md) for the GitOps overlay.

## Components deployed

Argo CD syncs two applications into namespace `aiq`:

- **aiq-backend** — NVIDIA AI-Q agent (`nvcr.io/nvidia/blueprint/aiq-agent`). Serves the research API on port 8000. The MaaS Granite workflow YAML is mounted from ConfigMap `aiq-maas-config`.
- **aiq-frontend** — Web UI (`nvcr.io/nvidia/blueprint/aiq-frontend`) on port 3000. Exposed via an OpenShift Route (`aiq-frontend`).
- **aiq-postgres** — In-cluster PostgreSQL with a PVC for jobs and checkpoints.
- **aiq-maas-config** — ConfigMap sourced from `charts/aiq-maas-config/files/config_maas_granite.yml`. The NGC backend image does not contain this overlay file.

`make install` also installs the Validated Patterns Operator, OpenShift GitOps (`vp-gitops`), and a `Pattern` custom resource. Secret `aiq-credentials` is loaded into `aiq` from `~/values-secret-aiq.yaml`.

## Deploying the demo

To run the demo, ensure Podman is running on your machine. Clone this repository and push the branch Argo CD should track (typically `main`).

### Login to OpenShift cluster

Replace the token and the API server URL in the command below to log in to the OpenShift cluster.

```bash
oc login --token=<token> --server=<api_server_url>
```

### Cloning repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/validatedpatterns-sandbox/RHAIF-Nvidia-AIQ.git
cd RHAIF-Nvidia-AIQ
```

### Configure secrets

This pattern deploys the MaaS Granite workflow profile out of the box. Copy the secrets template and fill in real values. Do not commit secrets.

```bash
cp values-secret.yaml.template ~/values-secret-aiq.yaml
# edit ~/values-secret-aiq.yaml
```

Set at minimum: `DB_USER_NAME`, `DB_USER_PASSWORD`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `AIQ_INFERENCE_BASE_URL`, `MAAS_MODEL_NAME`. `TAVILY_API_KEY` may be empty for install-only smoke tests. `NVIDIA_API_KEY` is not required for the MaaS Granite profile.

Secrets use the Validated Patterns `none` backend (not Vault): `./pattern.sh make install` writes Kubernetes Secret `aiq-credentials` in namespace `aiq` from this file. For the full API key matrix used in local development, see [Obtain API Keys](#obtain-api-keys).

### GPU nodes

The default MaaS Granite overlay does **not** require GPU nodes on the cluster. Skip GPU MachineSet provisioning unless you switch to a self-hosted GPU model profile.

### Deploy application

`values-global.yaml` sets `global.singleArgoCD: true` so clustergroup Applications are created in the `vp-gitops` Argo CD instance installed by `make install`:

```yaml
global:
  pattern: aiq
  singleArgoCD: true
  secretStore:
    backend: none
main:
  clusterGroupName: prod
```

Following commands take about 15–20 minutes.

> **Validated pattern will be deployed**

```bash
./pattern.sh make validate-prereq
./pattern.sh make validate-cluster
./pattern.sh make install
./pattern.sh make argo-healthcheck
```

`make install` installs the Validated Patterns Operator, OpenShift GitOps, the `Pattern` resource, and loads `aiq-credentials`. Argo CD then syncs `aiq-maas-config` and `aiq`.

### 1: Verify the installation

- Log in to the OpenShift web console.
- Navigate to **Workloads** → **Pods**.
- Select the **`aiq`** project from the drop-down.
- Confirm `aiq-backend`, `aiq-frontend`, and `aiq-postgres` pods are **Running**, and the Postgres PVC is **Bound**.

From the CLI:

```bash
oc get pods,pvc -n aiq
oc -n aiq port-forward svc/aiq-backend 8000:8000
# in another terminal:
curl -sf http://127.0.0.1:8000/live && echo
curl -sf http://127.0.0.1:8000/health && echo
```

### 2: Launch the application

Primary UI access — open the OpenShift Route:

```bash
oc get route aiq-frontend -n aiq
```

Open the `HOST/PORT` URL in a browser (edge TLS, HTTP redirected to HTTPS).

Fallback — port-forward the frontend:

```bash
oc -n aiq port-forward svc/aiq-frontend 3000:3000
```

Then open http://127.0.0.1:3000.

### 3: Run a research query

- Open the AI-Q UI from the Route URL.
- In **Data Sources**, enable **Web Search** (if `TAVILY_API_KEY` is configured).
- Enter a short prompt (for example, `Reply with exactly: OK`) and send the message.
- Confirm the assistant responds in the chat session.

### 4: Verify the API (optional)

With the backend port-forward from step 1, submit a generate request:

```bash
curl -sf http://127.0.0.1:8000/generate \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"query": "Reply with exactly: OK"}'
```

A `200` response with assistant content confirms MaaS wiring beyond the UI.

### 5: Async deep research (optional)

For long-running research jobs, SSE replay, report follow-up, and durable artifact access on a running deployment, refer to the [REST API documentation](docs/source/integration/rest-api.md).

## Advanced usage and development

The sections below cover local development, workflow configuration, and product depth beyond the OpenShift Validated Pattern install path.

### Local development setup

#### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/validatedpatterns-sandbox/RHAIF-Nvidia-AIQ.git && cd RHAIF-Nvidia-AIQ
```

#### Automated Setup

Run the setup script to initialize the environment:

```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
```

This script:

- Creates a Python virtual environment with uv
- Installs all Python dependencies (core, frontends, benchmarks, data sources)
- Installs UI dependencies (if Node.js is available)

#### Manual Installation

For selective installation, install packages individually:

```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
uv venv --python 3.13 .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install core with development dependencies
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Install frontends (pick what you need)
uv pip install -e ./frontends/cli          # CLI frontend
uv pip install -e ./frontends/debug        # Debug console
uv pip install -e ./frontends/aiq_api      # Unified API (includes debug)

# Install benchmarks (pick what you need)
uv pip install -e ./frontends/benchmarks/freshqa

# Install data sources (pick what you need)
uv pip install -e ./sources/tavily_web_search
uv pip install -e ./sources/exa_web_search
uv pip install -e ./sources/google_scholar_paper_search
uv pip install -e ./sources/nimble_web_search
uv pip install -e ./sources/you_com
uv pip install -e "./sources/knowledge_layer[llamaindex,foundational_rag]"
```

#### Obtain API Keys

2. Click on any model, then select "Deploy" > "Get API Key" > "Generate Key"

##### Obtain a Tavily API Key

1. Sign in to [Tavily](https://tavily.com/)
2. Navigate to your dashboard
3. Generate an API key

##### Obtain an Exa API Key

1. Sign in to [Exa](https://exa.ai/)
2. Create an API key from the dashboard
3. Add it to `deploy/.env` as `EXA_API_KEY`

Refer to the `exa_web_search` section in the
[Configuration Reference](docs/source/customization/configuration-reference.md) for workflow usage.

##### Obtain a You.com API Key

Follow the [You.com quickstart](https://you.com/docs/quickstart) to create an API key and add it to `deploy/.env` as
`YDC_API_KEY`. Refer to [You.com API Suite](docs/source/customization/you-com.md) for tool configuration.

##### Obtain a Paper Search API Key

Paper search supports three interchangeable providers. Set the `provider` field on the `paper_search` function in your workflow config (defaults to `serper`):

| Provider | Environment Variable | Sign-up |

#### Set Up Environment Variables

For local and Compose modes, create a `.env` file in the `deploy/` directory:

```bash
cp deploy/.env.example deploy/.env
```

Replace your API keys. For OpenShift GitOps, use `~/values-secret-aiq.yaml` instead (see [Configure secrets](#configure-secrets)).

> **Note:** Depending on your usecase, deep research report quality can be enhanced by enabling searching across academic research papers. We use Serper for this. If you want to use paper search, follow the steps in the [Customization guide](docs/source/customization/tools-and-sources.md#disabling-a-tool) to enable it.

### Configuration Files

The `configs/` directory holds YAML workflow configs that define agents, tools, LLMs, and routing. Use the one that matches your run mode and data sources:

### Ways to Run the Agents

The `frontends/` directory contains different interfaces for interacting with the agents. You can also run agents directly through the NeMo Agent Toolkit CLI.

#### Command-line interface (CLI)

The CLI provides an interactive research assistant in your terminal:

```bash
# Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Run with the convenience script
./scripts/start_cli.sh

# Verbose logging
./scripts/start_cli.sh --verbose

# Or run directly with the NeMo Agent Toolkit CLI (dotenv loads deploy/.env into the environment)
dotenv -f deploy/.env run nat run --config_file configs/config_cli_default.yml --input "How do I install CUDA?"
```

The CLI frontend source is in `frontends/cli/`.

#### Web UI

For a full web-based experience on your workstation:

```bash
./scripts/start_e2e.sh
```

This starts:

- Backend API server at `http://localhost:8000`
- Frontend UI at `http://localhost:3000`

The web UI source is in `frontends/ui/`. Refer to [frontends/ui/README.md](frontends/ui/README.md) for more details.

On OpenShift, use the Route from [2: Launch the application](#2-launch-the-application) instead of localhost.

##### Web UI with Docker Compose

You can also run the backend and UI with Docker Compose:

```bash
cd deploy/compose

# No-auth local setup (LlamaIndex default)
docker compose --env-file ../.env -f docker-compose.yaml up -d --build

# To select a different backend config, set BACKEND_CONFIG in deploy/.env, for example:
# BACKEND_CONFIG=/app/configs/config_web_frag.yml
```

For more details, refer to:

- `deploy/compose/README.md`

#### Async Deep Research Jobs

For public endpoints, SSE replay, report follow-up, and durable artifact access, refer to the
[REST API documentation](docs/source/integration/rest-api.md).

#### MCP Server

Expose AI-Q to MCP clients through the standalone, stateless Streamable HTTP server:

```bash
: "${NVIDIA_API_KEY:?Set NVIDIA_API_KEY}"
: "${TAVILY_API_KEY:?Set TAVILY_API_KEY}"
uv sync --project mcp --frozen
AIQ_CHECKPOINT_DB=postgresql://localhost/aiq_jobs \
  uv run --project mcp --frozen aiq-mcp-server
```

The endpoint defaults to `http://localhost:9001/mcp` and advertises exactly `submit_query`, `poll_query`, and
`get_final_report`. This public server intentionally has no authentication; job UUIDs are bearer capabilities and
the endpoint must not be exposed directly to an untrusted network. See [Expose AI-Q as an MCP Server](docs/source/integration/mcp-server.md)
for the exact JSON protocol, health contracts, security model, and container deployment.

MCP is an independent uv project with its own `mcp/uv.lock`. The root lock remains compatible with NAT's
`cryptography<47` constraint, while the frozen MCP release/container profile pins `cryptography==50.0.0` as a
security hardening measure. The release-supported platform is Linux x86_64 with CPython 3.13, through either the
frozen source project or the release container. Other 64-bit source hosts are development-only; x86_64 macOS and
32-bit Windows are unsupported because `cryptography` 50 does not publish those wheels. Run the release container
on a supported 64-bit Linux/container host. The MCP package's local path dependency closure is not published as a
standalone wheel. See the
[MCP security policy](mcp/SECURITY.md#platform-compatibility) for the full platform contract.

#### Benchmarks

To run agents in evaluation mode, refer to the [Evaluating the Workflow](#evaluating-the-workflow) section.

#### Jupyter Notebooks

The `docs/notebooks/` directory contains a three-part series that walks through the blueprint from first run to full customization. Run them in order:

| # | Notebook | What it covers | Prerequisites |
|---|----------|----------------|---------------|
| 0 | [Getting Started with AI-Q](docs/notebooks/0_Getting_Started_with_AIQ.ipynb) | Full blueprint overview — environment setup, orchestrated workflow (intent routing, shallow and deep research), and Docker Compose deployment | `NVIDIA_API_KEY`; optionally `TAVILY_API_KEY`, `SERPER_API_KEY` |
| 1 | [Deep Researcher — Web Search](docs/notebooks/1_Deep_Researcher_Web_Search.ipynb) | Deep researcher in depth — Python API, `nat run`, and end-to-end evaluation against the DeepResearch Bench with `nat eval` | Notebook 0 completed; `NVIDIA_API_KEY`, `TAVILY_API_KEY`, `SERPER_API_KEY`; OpenAI or Gemini key for the judge model |
| 2 | [Deep Researcher — Customization](docs/notebooks/2_Deep_Researcher_Customization.ipynb) | Extending the deep researcher — adding paper search, assigning different LLMs per agent role, editing prompts, and enabling the knowledge layer | Notebooks 0 and 1 completed; `NVIDIA_API_KEY`, `TAVILY_API_KEY`, `SERPER_API_KEY` |

### Evaluating the Workflow

The `frontends/benchmarks/` directory contains evaluation pipelines for assessing agent performance.

#### Available Benchmarks

| Benchmark | Description | Location |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Deep Research Bench | RACE and FACT evaluation for research quality | `frontends/benchmarks/deepresearch_bench/` |
| FreshQA | Factuality evaluation on time-sensitive questions | `frontends/benchmarks/freshqa/` |

#### Running Evaluations

##### Step 1: Install the dataset

The dataset files are not included in the repository. We have included a script to retrieve them from the [Deep Research Bench Github Repository](https://github.com/Ayanami0730/deep_research_bench/tree/main) and format them for the NeMo Agent Toolkit evaluator.

To download the dataset files, run the following script:

```bash
python frontends/benchmarks/deepresearch_bench/scripts/download_drb_dataset.py
```

##### Step 2: Generate reports using NAT evaluation harness

```bash
dotenv -f deploy/.env run nat eval --config_file frontends/benchmarks/deepresearch_bench/configs/config_deep_research_bench.yml
```

##### Step 3: Convert the output into a compatible format

```bash
python frontends/benchmarks/deepresearch_bench/scripts/export_drb_jsonl.py --input <path to your workflow_output.json> --output <path to the output file you want to create with .jsonl extension>
```

##### Step 4: Run evaluation

Follow instructions in the [Deep Research Bench Github Repository](https://github.com/Ayanami0730/deep_research_bench/tree/main) to run evaluation and obtain scores.

##### Optional: Phoenix Tracing

If your config enables Phoenix tracing, start the Phoenix server before running `nat eval`.

Start server (separate terminal):

```bash
uvx --from arize-phoenix phoenix serve
```

### Roadmap

The checkboxes below track implementation in the current branch; a checked item does not by itself
indicate availability in a published release.

- [x] **[NeMo Guardrails](docs/source/customization/guardrails.md) Integration:** Opt-in middleware for selected workflow, shallow-researcher, and deep-researcher boundaries.
- [ ] **[NVIDIA Dynamo](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo) Integration:** Reduce latency via priority scheduling at scale.
- [x] **Per-user MCP OAuth:** Connect each signed-in user to protected MCP data sources through the UI.
- [x] **Skills & Sandboxing:** Support host-side, role-assigned deep-research skills and provider-neutral execution. Modal and OpenShell create one physical sandbox per deep-research job.
- [x] **Report Follow-up and Rewriting:** Answer against a completed report, submit cosmetic child rewrites, and run delta research with parent-report context.
- [x] **Durable Sandbox Artifacts:** Opt-in manifest checkpoints after successful sandbox commands, terminal harvesting on success/failure, SQL or S3-compatible byte storage, and live/replayed Files-tab access.
- [ ] **Custom Skill Management:** Add UI and lifecycle controls for user-provided skill bundles.
- [ ] **Dynamic Model Routing:** Allow sub-agents to automatically select the optimal model per task.
- [ ] **Resource Management:** Implement configurable token caps and tool-call budgets.
- [x] **Expanded Web Search:** Tavily, Exa, You.com, and Nimble integrations with configurable source selection.
- [ ] **Additional Search Providers:** Add integration examples including Perplexity.
- [ ] **Multimedia Output:** Embed audio, video, and images directly into reports.
- [ ] **Voice-to-Text Input:** Integrate [NVIDIA Riva](https://developer.nvidia.com/riva) for hands-free accessibility.

### Security Considerations

- The AI-Q Blueprint is shared as a reference and is provided "as is". The security in the production environment is the responsibility of the end users deploying it. When deploying in a production environment, please have security experts review any potential risks and threats; define the trust boundaries, implement logging and monitoring capabilities, secure the communication channels, integrate AuthN & AuthZ with appropriate access controls, keep the deployment up to date, ensure the containers/source code are secure and free of known vulnerabilities.
- A robust frontend that handles AuthN & AuthZ is highly recommended. Missing AuthN & AuthZ will result in ungated access to customer models if directly exposed e.g. the internet, resulting in either cost to the customer, resource exhaustion, or denial of service.
- AI-Q includes opt-in [NeMo Guardrails middleware](docs/source/customization/guardrails.md) for selected workflow and agent boundaries. Guardrails are not enabled universally; operators must attach and test the policies required for their deployment.
- Optional [async job content encryption](docs/source/deployment/content-encryption.md) protects final job output and selected artifact-event content only. It is off by default and is not full database-level job-content encryption.
- The AI-Q Blueprint doesn't require any privileged access to the system.
- Deep research skills can invoke sandboxed code execution for analysis workflows. Keep sandbox credentials, quotas, lifecycle cleanup, attestation, and network policy aligned with your deployment's trust boundaries. Shared OpenShell attachment is an explicit debug-only mode and is not job-isolated.
- End users are responsible for ensuring the availability of their deployment.
- End users are responsible for building, and patching, the container images to keep them up to date.
- The end users are responsible for ensuring that OSS packages used by the developer blueprint are current.
- The built-in workflow and agent logger paths redact raw prompts, tool payloads, and model completions. Enabled source adapters, external middleware, model and tool providers, tracing exporters, and reverse proxies can have separate request-logging and retention behavior; audit and configure every enabled component independently, and keep production logs access-controlled.
