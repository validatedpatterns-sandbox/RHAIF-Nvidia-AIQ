# NVIDIA AI-Q Blueprint

An NVIDIA blueprint for AI-powered deep research, built on the NeMo Agent Toolkit. AI-Q is a deployable research
backend that teams can self-host and connect to deployment-owned models, data, authentication, policy controls,
storage, and observability. It combines intelligent query routing, multi-agent research pipelines, and pluggable
knowledge retrieval to deliver citation-backed answers. It is focused on governed research workflows rather than
general-purpose coding-agent execution.

## Where to Start
